## Project overview
Bworks is an organization that promotes sustainability, literacy, community service, and fun. BYTE services and BYCYCLE services are their two key offerings.

"Test"

The goal of this project is to create a community service program for Bworks, a business that specializes in bicycle programs. Tracking provider information, bicycle 
inventory, and delivery data are the goals. A user-friendly online application with features including provider registration, bicycle listing, delivery tracking, and 
reporting will be created as part of the project. Each segment of the project will have its own time frame and be broken down into milestones.

## Project Objectives: 
+ Create an Automated Email Gratitude System for Donators.
+ Create an intuitive web application that enables Bworks to monitor provider information, bicycle inventory, and delivery details.
+ Give Bworks access to the tools it needs to register service providers, list bicycles, monitor delivery, and produce reports.
+ The effectiveness and efficiency of Bworks' bicycle programs needs to be improved via this open source project.
+ Increasing the availability of bicycles for those in need.

## Features
+ Able to send Emails with Photos for Donators.
+ Able to track provider details.
+ Able to track delivery information.
+ Look up bicycle inventory.

## Gratitude:
Upon completion of the program or course, upon the kids parents or garden agree to share a story or  message of their kids experiences, the email will be sent to the bike donor. For privacy concerns, only names and photos will be shared if they agree.

## Buyers:
People who are interested can buy from the website directly, and for every one who purchases the bicycles, it sends an email to the buyer (which helps more children get a free course and a bike).
Buyers can also purchase custom parts from the website.

## Program:
BWorks gives kids the chance to earn a free bike while they learn about bicycle safety and maintenance from our volunteers. By registering for the classes.
