# Bworks
## Project overview
Bworks is an organization that promotes sustainability, literacy, community service, and fun. BYTE services and BYCYCLE services are their two key offerings. 
BYCYCLE services include receiving contributions of children's and adult-size bicycles, distributing them to the public, and repairing bicycles that are in poor condition. 
BYTE services include setting up computer classes.

The goal of this project is to create a community service program for Bworks, a business that specializes in bicycle programs. Tracking provider information, bicycle 
inventory, and delivery data are the goals. A user-friendly online application with features including provider registration, bicycle listing, delivery tracking, and 
reporting will be created as part of the project. Each segment of the project will have its own timeframe and be broken down into milestones.

## Project Objectives: 
+ Create an intuitive web application that enables Bworks to monitor provider information, bicycle inventory, and delivery details.
+ Give Bworks access to the tools it needs to register service providers, list bicycles, monitor delivery, and produce reports.
+ The effectiveness and efficiency of Bworks' bicycle programs needs toÂ be improved via this open source project.
+ Increasing the availability of bicycles for those in need.
