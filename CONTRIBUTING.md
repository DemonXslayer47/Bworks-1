### Please follow these steps to contribute:
+ Fork the project on GitHub.
+ Create a new branch for your changes.
+ Make your changes and commit them.
+ Push your changes to your branch.
+ Publish a pull request for the main branch.
+ If your pull request adheres to our criteria, we'll review it and merge it.

### Expectations
All contributions must adhere to the following requirements, at a minimum:
+ The code needs to be carefully written and tested.

+ The bug reports need to be precise and reproducible.
+ The feature requests must be well-defined and feasible.



## Release Process
The release process is a critical phase in the project lifecycle that ensures the deployment of stable and reliable software to users. This section outlines the steps and best practices for managing releases effectively.

### Versioning Scheme
To maintain a clear and consistent approach to versioning, we use [insert versioning scheme here]. The version number typically consists of three parts: major version, minor version, and patch version. Here's a brief explanation of each component:

Major Version: Represents significant milestones or major feature releases. A change in the major version indicates possible breaking changes and may require user adaptation.
Minor Version: Signifies the addition of new features or enhancements that are backward compatible with the previous version.
Patch Version: Denotes bug fixes, patches, or minor updates that don't introduce new features and maintain backward compatibility.

### Release Branching Strategy
We follow the [insert branching strategy here] branching strategy for managing releases. This strategy ensures a structured and controlled approach to releasing new features and bug fixes. The key branches involved in the release process are:

Main/Branch: Represents the production-ready codebase. Only stable and thoroughly tested code should be merged into this branch.
Application/Branch: Acts as the integration branch for ongoing development. Feature branches are merged into this branch for testing and review.

### Release Workflow
The release workflow consists of several steps to ensure a smooth and reliable release process. Here's an overview of the typical workflow:

* Feature Development: Developers work on new features or bug fixes in separate feature branches, branching off from the development branch.
Feature Testing: Each feature branch undergoes thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and any relevant automation tests.
* Code Review: All feature branches must go through a code review process to ensure code quality, adherence to coding standards, and best practices.
* Integration: Once a feature branch passes the code review, it is merged into the development branch for integration testing.
* Release Candidate: When the development branch is considered stable, a release branch is created from it. This branch is dedicated to finalizing the release candidate.
* Testing: The release candidate is thoroughly tested to identify and fix any remaining issues or bugs.
Documentation Update: Update the project documentation, including release notes, user guides, and any other relevant documentation to reflect the changes and new features introduced in the release.
* Release Approval: The release candidate is reviewed by the project stakeholders, including product managers and QA teams, to ensure it meets the required quality standards.
* Merge to Main: Once the release candidate is approved, it is merged into the main branch, triggering the official release process.
* Deployment: The release is deployed to the production environment following the defined deployment process and any relevant infrastructure automation.
* Post-Release Tasks: Conduct post-release activities such as monitoring, bug tracking, user feedback collection, and performance analysis to address any issues that arise.

### Release Documentation
Clear and comprehensive release documentation is crucial for providing users and stakeholders with information about the release and its impact. The following information should be included in the release documentation:

* Release version and date
* Overview of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes
Known issues and limitations
* Upgrade instructions, if applicable
* Contact information for support or feedback
  
It is important to maintain an organized and accessible repository of release documentation, making it easy for users to access information about previous releases.
